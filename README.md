#### Welcome to my Github 


I am currently undergoing further training as a web and software developer at Digital Career Institute.  

Initially, I will be focusing on HTML5, CSS, JavaScript and React. 

I am excited to fill my GitHub profile with great projects soon!

##### Something about me
I live in Leipzig, Germany.

In my free time, I play the guitar and the piano. I love music, especially punkrock! 🤘 

I really enjoy Halloween time 🎃 and feel most comfortable in autumn 🍂

**Feel free to ask me something!**
